                    <h3>problem statement </h3>
                    <p>Students between the age of 18 and 28 already have
                        enough things to pay for with little money, so things like
                        exploring and tasting new culture to the fullest while
                        traveling abroad isn't always possible​.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>the goal</h3>
                    <p>The goal of the app is to help students find the cheapest places
                        to eat culinair food while the are traveling abroad.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>how does it work</h3>
                    <p>By entering your budget on the app, it keeps track of your expenses every day
                        and and it also helps you find the best places nearby to eat that fit your (daily) budget.
                        The app provides restaurants/food nearby that fit your (daily) budget by picking 
                        one of the options to eat: pick up, deliver, restaurant or street food, the app provides.
                        The app is connectable with a smartwatch that keeps track of your location and food
                        ​</p>
