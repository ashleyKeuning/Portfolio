                    <h3>problem statement </h3>
                    <p>In the time of the pandemic, people are not feeling
                        motivated to workout, one of the main reasons is because
                        of the closed gyms and since most of people don't have
                        the equipment to workout at home, is the only option for
                        people to stay active is to do outdoor activities such as
                        jogging and cycling, which is for some people not the
                        most exciting thing to do.  
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>the goal</h3>
                    <p>The goal of the app is to make the users feel motivated
                        to workout by improving and make their workout and the 
                        experience more fun and interesting during their outdoor
                        activities.

                <div>
                    <h3>how does it work</h3>
                    <p>Actividay is an app that helps improving your experience during
                        your outdoor activity and motivates you to stay active.
                        By letting the app pick out the best clothes for you to wear for your
                        activity by taking the weather and forecasts in account.
                        The app also provides the best routes for you to follow per location
                        and it also makes sure that you come across hotspots and sightseeing
                        points on your route, it also keeps track of your actions and achievements.
                        The app also allows you to connect with Spotify so you can listen to
                        music that enhances or liften up your mood
                        ​</p>

                <p>My responsibility during this project was to take charge of the project.
                    I make sure that everything is going smoothly by communicating a lot with my team.

                    Making sure to always be a step ahead of my team, by knowing what's next, plan ahead,
                    informing my team about the plan and possible actions we could take.
